# CAD Files

These are the CAD files for the metal version. I did the CAD in [Alibre Atom3D](https://www.alibre.com/atom3d/), which costs around $150 for a perpetual license, but which does offer a 1-month long free trial. 

A [STEP file assembly](https://github.com/bluepylons/Boston/blob/master/Boston%20-%20Current%20design/Metal%20version/Boston-metal-assembly.stp) (which can be opened by almost any 3D CAD program) is in the main Metal Version directory. 

STEP files for just the case top and bottom (for sending to a machine shop for ordering) is in the [Case > STEP](https://github.com/bluepylons/Boston/tree/master/Boston%20-%20Current%20design/Metal%20version/Case/STEP) directory. An STL of the LED spacer for 3D printing is in the [Case > STLs](https://github.com/bluepylons/Boston/tree/master/Boston%20-%20Current%20design/Metal%20version/Case/STL%20(3D%20print)) directory. STEP and DXF files for the plates are in the [Plate](https://github.com/bluepylons/Boston/tree/master/Boston%20-%20Current%20design/Metal%20version/Plate) directory.
