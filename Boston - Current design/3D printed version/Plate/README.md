# Plate files for the 3D-printed version

These are the FR4 plate files.These can be manufactured at any PCB fab. 

The "Current plate" has not been tested, but has been verified in CAD. The sole change is that this fixes the mistake with the numpad stabilizer cutout being flipped on the older plates. That is the only thing that has changed, and the files have been checked in CAD. 

The "Plate that shipped with V0.5.2 PCBs" has been tested, but as noted, the numpad Enter key stabilizer cutout is backwards. This results in the stab wires hitting the cutout, which results in a "clack" sound on the return. This can be fixed by filing the opening slightly. 

The "Old Plate' does not support split space or alternate bottom row layouts. This also has no solder mask on the top side as I wanted to see what the shiny HASL-Leadfree finish looked like (it ended up being inconsistent, so I opted for solder mask on the later versions). This also has the mistake on the numpad Enter key stabilizer cutout. This was used for the very first prototype, and is confirmed to work.
